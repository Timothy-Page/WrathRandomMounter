#When loaded the addon will create a "Mount" macro
#When the "Mount" macro is run it will update the mounts that are in the macro to a random mount from your bag so that the next time you use it you will get a different mount.
#Checks to see if you are in a flying zone and uses a flying mound if you are.
#Can force a ground mount in a flying zone by holding alt
